# Amazon-Product-Review-Analysis
## My first Project in Digital skill Up
### Project Overview
This project analyzes Amazon product data to uncover insights that can drive smarter business decisions. Using Excel tools such as Pivot Tables, Calculated Columns, and Charts, we explored key metrics like average ratings, discount percentages, product pricing, and review volume across different categories.

The goal was to identify top-performing products, evaluate customer satisfaction, and understand how pricing strategies impact product visibility. The final dashboard and insights offer actionable recommendations for product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement to enhance overall performance on the Amazon marketplace
